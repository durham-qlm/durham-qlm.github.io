 _Current PhD students in the QLM group_<br>


When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, you’ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a laptop and a desk in a shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when two people will present updates from their project, all PhD students and postdocs will be included in this rota. During term time we also host weekly <a href="https://durham-qlm.uk/seminars/">seminars</a> from 
external speakers. You will also travel to attend  national, and international conferences where you will meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>
