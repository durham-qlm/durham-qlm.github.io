 _Current PhD students in the QLM group_<br>


When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, you’ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a desk in the shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when each team member is given the opportunity to share updates from their project. During term time we host weekly <a href="https://durham-qlm.uk/seminars/">seminars</a> from 
external speakers. These is also the opportunity to travel and attend international conferences and meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>

There are different mechanisms for funding a PhD, most common are:<br>
<b>Funded</b> (the source of funding is already attached to the project).<br>
<b>Competition funded</b> (the project is in competition for funding with other projects).<br>
<b>External scholarships</b> (the student is in competition for funding, a list of scholarships can be found <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/scholarships/postgraduate/">here</a>).<br>

If you join a project through any of these routes your university fees will be covered, and you will receive a tax-free stipend of £20,780 per year. Information regarding the application process can be found <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research-degrees/how-to-apply/">here</a>. It is also possible to self-fund, please discuss this option directly with the supervisor.<br>
