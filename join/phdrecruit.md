 _Current PhD students in the QLM group_<br>
  
When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, you’ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a desk in the shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when each team member is given the opportunity to share updates from their project. During term time we host weekly <a href="https://durham-qlm.uk/seminars/">seminars</a> from 
external speakers. These is also the opportunity to travel and attend international conferences and meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>

There are different mechanisms for funding a PhD, most common are:<br>
<b>Funded</b> (the source of funding is already attached to the project).<br>
<b>Competition funded</b> (the project is in competition for funding with other projects).<br>
<b>External scholarships</b> (the student is in competition for funding, a list of scholarships can be found <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/scholarships/postgraduate/">here</a>).<br>

If you join a project through any of these routes your university fees will be covered, and you will receive a tax-free stipend of £20,780 per year. Information regarding the application process can be found <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research-degrees/how-to-apply/">here</a>. It is also possible to self-fund, please discuss this option directly with the supervisor.<br>

We have a selection of PhD projects available for an October 2026 start (listed below). If you are interested in any of these projects please contact the relevant supervisor directly, and register <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/QME9a3m98W">here</a> to attend our open day on <b>November 26th</b> (11am-4pm). Registration deadline 21st November.<br>

 In this project, you’ll develop a unique optical tweezer platform to assemble designer quantum systems atom by atom. Using lasers and magnetic fields, you’ll cool atoms to near absolute zero, trap them individually, and prepare them in precise quantum states. Our approach will leverage two distinct atomic species with unique optical transitions, allowing independent control. One species serves as data qubits, while the other acts as ancillas—supporting qubits that can monitor and control the system, that are essential for error correction and novel quantum sensing schemes.<br>
 
You will explore techniques to generate useful entanglement in this system investigating long-range dipolar interactions mediated by Rydberg states—where atoms have electrons excited to giant orbits, resulting in strong interactions. Ultimately, this project aims to construct precisely engineered quantum systems atom by atom, to realise new quantum devices with applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and fundamental physics. <br>
The project is supported by the supervisor’s Royal Society University Research Fellowship. Candidates will gain hands-on experience in optical trapping, laser cooling, and quantum state engineering, while engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge fundamental quantum science with industrial applications.

      	<h5><a id="spindynamics">Quantum spin dynamics with ultracold polar molecules</a></h5><br>
Understanding quantum systems of many interacting particles is one of the greatest challenges in modern physics. In this project, you will study an artificial quantum system constructed by loading ultracold RbCs molecules into an optical lattice. Dipolar interactions can be precisely engineered between the molecules generating quantum entanglement and coherent many-body states, and the resulting dynamics observed using a quantum gas microscope that enables the detection of the position and state of individual molecules in the array. <br><br> 

As part of our team, you will join our established RbCs quantum gas microscope experiment. This project will extend our current capabilities by implementing a rotationally-magic trap for the molecules that enables highly coherent spins to be encoded into the rotational states of the molecules. You will study of a range of tunable spin models in experiments, and have opportunities to collaborate with world-renowned local and international theory partners. <br><br>

We have pioneered a new approach to forming ultracold RbCs molecules. We take single atoms of Rb and Cs confined in separate optical tweezers, cool them to motional ground state of their respective traps and then carefully combine them to form a molecule in the rovibrational ground state. In this project you will construct an array of strongly interacting ultracold molecules and Rydberg atoms confined in optical tweezers. You will learn how to engineer resonant dipole-dipole interactions between individual atoms and molecules by tuning the energy difference between a pair of Rydberg levels to match the spacing of a rotational transition in the molecule. You will then harness this interaction to address two of the key challenges in the field of ultracold molecules: (1) to perform non-destructive detection and state sensitive readout of the molecule, and (2) to realise fast high-fidelity entangling operations between molecules. <br><br>

This project is supported by a new UKRI research grant. <br><br>

      	<h5><a id="tweezers">Tweezers generation II </a></h5><br>
Single atom trapping and control with optical tweezers has become a major research theme throughout the world and many quantum startup companies are using this approach to develop platforms for quantum computation. In Durham we have an experiment that can trap single atoms of Rb and Cs in separate species-specific optical tweezers and then carefully combine them to form a molecule. The original apparatus is capable of forming up to 5 molecules in a linear array. In this project you will contribute to the construction of a second-generation apparatus aiming to produce interleaved 2D arrays of over 500 Rb and Cs atoms. <br>

 The use of two atomic species, rather than the single species employed in most experiments, enables independent control and crosstalk-free measurement of the two species, facilitating the mid-circuit qubit operations needed for quantum error correction. Additionally, the setup can also be used to create arrays of RbCs molecules.  You will explore combining the tweezer array with optical lattices, firstly to enhance the efficiency of producing molecules and secondly to transfer the atoms or molecules into a the lattice to study tunnelling and many-body dynamics for these different systems.<br><br>

This 4-year project is partly funded by <a href="https://www.pasqal.com/">Pasqal</a> a world-leading neutral-atom quantum computing company based in France. As part of this project you will have the opportunity to spend time in their Paris labs.<br>

      	<h5><a id="CsYb">Leveraging Yb clock states to form CsYb molecules in optical lattices </a></h5><br>
Ultracold polar molecules offer a wide range of exciting research directions spanning ultracold chemistry, precision measurement, quantum simulation and quantum computation. Numerous applications stem from the long-range dipolar interactions and rich internal structure of vibration and rotation. Enormous progress has been made in assembling pairs of alkali atoms to form bialkali molecules – including by our group in Durham using Rb and Cs. However, there is a need to diversify the range of molecules available. In this project you will use an existing state-of-the-art experiment to form CsYb molecules. By combining an alkali atom (Cs) with closed-shell atom (Yb) you will form a molecule that has both an electric dipole moment and a magnetic dipole moment. Your strategy will be to the metastable clock states in Yb where our theoretical work predicts relatively broad collision resonances with Cs that can be used to form molecules. You will also use a magic wavelength optical lattice and learn how to prepare Cs-Yb atom pairs in this lattice. Converting the atom pairs into molecules will realise a new and exciting platform for quantum simulation of many-body physics. <br><br>
