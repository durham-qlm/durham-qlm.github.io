 _Current PhD students in the QLM group_<br>
  
When you join Durham Quantum Light and Matter (QLM) as a PhD or Master by research student, you’ll become a member of a friendly research section home to almost 50 members, 
including permanent staff, research fellows, research associates and PhD students. <br>

Each graduate cohort receives training in skills required to excel in the program. This includes lecture courses in atom-light interactions and advanced data analysis, 
and experimental skills workshops on CAD design and optics. Students and postdoctoral researchers are all given a desk in the shared office enabling easy sharing of ideas and problem solving. <br>

Each week begins with our group meeting, when each team member is given the opportunity to share updates from their project. During term time we host weekly seminars from 
external speakers. These is also the opportunity to travel and attend international conferences and meet researchers from around the world. These are just some of the 
opportunities and benefits available to members of the group. <br>

We have a selection of funded PhD projects available for an October 2025 start (listed below). In addition we support the application to <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/scholarships/postgraduate/">scholarships</a>. Futher information regarding the application process can be found <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research-degrees/how-to-apply/">here</a>.<br>

	<h5><a id="terahertz">High Speed Terahertz Imaging using Rydberg Atoms.</a></h5> <br>
The terahertz (THz) frequency band lies between the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because THz radiation is non-ionising and passes through materials such as paper, cloth, and   plastics, it finds applications including security screening, biomedical imaging, and production-line monitoring. The THz region has traditionally been a difficult frequency range to work in because it falls between ranges of electronic and photonic devices - This is known as the ‘terahertz gap’ and although significant progress has been made to close this gap, applications are still limited by the low power output of THz sources and the low speed and sensitivity of THz detectors. In Durham, we have recently developed a new technology for terahertz imaging that uses Rydberg atoms to convert terahertz radiation to optical fluorescence. This has allowed unprecedented speed and sensitivity in image acquisition. This experimental Ph.D. project will push our technology to the next level by using laser pulse sequences to allow very short exposure images. This will allow very fast phenomena, such as shockwaves, to be studied in optically opaque media. The work is linked to the National Quantum Technology Hub programme and Industrial partners.<br>

	<h5><a id="vlight">Vector light project.</a></h5><br>
	The Durham Quantum Light and Matter group is internationally leading on experiments in the field of spectroscopy of atomic vapours.   Most treatments of the propagation of light through a medium assume that the     polarisation vector is two dimensional, i.e. restricted to the transverse plane. Recent study has shown that far more interesting and useful three-dimensional structures can be obtained by tightly focussing a       laser beam. We have shown in Durham that using shaped light enables the production of topologically non-trivial polarization. <br>
  The objective of this project is to analyse the spectrum of Rb vapour in large magnetic fields (we have our own 1.5 Tesla permanent magnet with different polarization states. The goals of the project are: (i) a     complete characterization of the spectroscopy of Rb vapour in large magnetic fields with tightly focussed fields; (ii) to investigate the interaction of atoms with topological light; (iii) explore the     possibilities of producing next generation sensors based on the interaction of structured light with atomic media.<br>

This 4-year studentship is sponsored by the National Quantum Computing Centre National Quantum Computing Centre - www.nqcc.ac.uk
<br><br>
The aim is to develop a new approach to creating three-dimensional arrays of ultra-cold strontium atoms, which can be addressed and read out individually, forming the qubits of a quantum computer. Currently, quantum computers based on two-dimensional atomic arrays (like the one produce in Durham and shown in the picture) are one of the platforms for quantum computation, with several companies now offering machines of ~100-1000 qubits for sale. However scaling to ~10,000 qubits will require new technologies, and an attractive approach is to use the third spatial dimension as the arrays can be made more compact, and the connectivity between qubits is improved. You will collaborate with the group of Dr Aidan Arnold and with the NQCC to develop custom optics for implementation in an existing strontium laser cooling experiment at Durham There will be the opportunity for visit, training and short placements at both locations.

      	<h5><a id="odd">Overwhelmingly dipolar diatomic (ODD) molecules </a></h5><br>
Ultracold polar molecules have important applications across the fields of quantum computation, quantum simulation, quantum chemistry, and the precision measurement of fundamental constants. One important feature of polar molecules is that they possess electric dipole moments that can be used to engineer long-range many-body entanglements, while cooling the molecules down to ultracold temperatures allows the study of these quantum effects free from thermal noise. <br><br>

In this project, you will join our team focused on producing ultracold RbAg and CsAg molecules. These molecules, containing silver (Ag), possess much larger dipole moments than are currently available in competing experiments. This will enable robust entangling operations to be performed more quickly and with less sensitivity to experimental noise. Following the roadmap developed on our highly-successful RbCs experiments, you will study and learn to control collisions between Ag and Rb/Cs atoms via interspecies Feshbach resonances, learn to associate pairs of atoms to form molecules in an ultracold atom mixture, and develop the techniques to transfer these molecules to their internal ground state. <br><br>

This 4-year project is funded by The Royal Society. <br><br>

      	<h5><a id="spindynamics">Quantum spin dynamics with ultracold polar molecules</a></h5><br>
Understanding quantum systems of many interacting particles is one of the greatest challenges in modern physics. In this project, you will study an artificial quantum system constructed by loading ultracold RbCs molecules into an optical lattice. Dipolar interactions can be precisely engineered between the molecules generating quantum entanglement and coherent many-body states, and the resulting dynamics observed using a quantum gas microscope that enables the detection of the position and state of individual molecules in the array. <br><br> 

As part of our team, you will join our established RbCs quantum gas microscope experiment. This project will extend our current capabilities by implementing a rotationally-magic trap for the molecules that enables highly coherent spins to be encoded into the rotational states of the molecules. You will study of a range of tunable spin models in experiments, and have opportunities to collaborate with world-renowned local and international theory partners. <br><br>

      	<h5><a id="RQO">Rydberg Quantum Optics</a></h5><br>
The goal of Rydberg quantum optics is to exploit the strong interactions between highly-excited Rydberg atoms to modify the properties of light at both the level of single photons and few photon coherent states. The applications are wide ranging from fast read-out of qubits in quantum computing to quantum optimisation problems like graph colouring, and complex system dynamics such a synchronisation and time crystals. The figure shows a fibre waveguide array coupling light in and out of an ensemble of ultra-cold atoms. The red laser excites some atoms to highly-excited Rydberg states (violet spheres) and thereby maps their strong interactions back onto the light.

The project is supported by funding from UKRI, Leverhulme and ESA. In addition, we benefit from an extended network of international collaborators.

      	<h5><a id="molryd">Enhancing molecular control using Rydberg atoms </a></h5><br>
We have pioneered a new approach to forming ultracold RbCs molecules. We take single atoms of Rb and Cs confined in separate optical tweezers, cool them to motional ground state of their respective traps and then carefully combine them to form a molecule in the rovibrational ground state. In this project you will construct an array of strongly interacting ultracold molecules and Rydberg atoms confined in optical tweezers. You will learn how to engineer resonant dipole-dipole interactions between individual atoms and molecules by tuning the energy difference between a pair of Rydberg levels to match the spacing of a rotational transition in the molecule. You will then harness this interaction to address two of the key challenges in the field of ultracold molecules: (1) to perform non-destructive detection and state sensitive readout of the molecule, and (2) to realise fast high-fidelity entangling operations between molecules. <br><br>

This project is supported by a new UKRI research grant. <br><br>

      	<h5><a id="tweezers">Tweezers generation II </a></h5><br>
Single atom trapping and control with optical tweezers has become a major research theme throughout the world and many quantum startup companies are using this approach to develop platforms for quantum computation. In Durham we have an experiment that can trap single atoms of Rb and Cs in separate species-specific optical tweezers and then carefully combine them to form a molecule. The original apparatus is capable of forming up to 5 molecules in a linear array. In this project you will contribute to the construction of a second-generation apparatus aiming to produce interleaved 2D arrays of over 500 Rb and Cs atoms. You will explore combining the tweezer array with optical lattices, firstly to enhance the efficiency of producing molecules and secondly to transfer the atoms or molecules into a the lattice to study tunnelling and many-body dynamics. <br><br>

      	<h5><a id="CsYb">Leveraging Yb clock states to form CsYb molecules in optical lattices </a></h5><br>
Ultracold polar molecules offer a wide range of exciting research directions spanning ultracold chemistry, precision measurement, quantum simulation and quantum computation. Numerous applications stem from the long-range dipolar interactions and rich internal structure of vibration and rotation. Enormous progress has been made in assembling pairs of alkali atoms to form bialkali molecules – including by our group in Durham using Rb and Cs. However, there is a need to diversify the range of molecules available. In this project you will use an existing state-of-the-art experiment to form CsYb molecules. By combining an alkali atom (Cs) with closed-shell atom (Yb) you will form a molecule that has both an electric dipole moment and a magnetic dipole moment. Your strategy will be to the metastable clock states in Yb where our theoretical work predicts relatively broad collision resonances with Cs that can be used to form molecules. You will also use a magic wavelength optical lattice and learn how to prepare Cs-Yb atom pairs in this lattice. Converting the atom pairs into molecules will realise a new and exciting platform for quantum simulation of many-body physics. <br><br>
