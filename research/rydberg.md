title: Rydberg Systems
subtitle: QLM's research involving Rydberg physics
---
Within QLM, multiple groups utilise the versatility of Rydberg systems. Our research ranges from [Rydberg Excitons](/research/rydberg/excitons) in cuprous oxide (Cu2O) to atomic Rydberg systems and Rydberg-molecule hybrid platforms. We make use of atomic Rydberg states in the divalent strontium atom for a [Sr Quantum Clock](/research/rydberg/strontium), in rubidium for [quantum optics via non-linear light-matter interactions](/research/rydberg/photonics), and in cesium atoms for studying [Nanotomics](/research/rydberg/nanotomics). Transitions between different Rydberg states are used for [THz imaging](https://durham-qlm.uk/research/tech/terahertz/) in Rb and Cs vapours at room temperature. Furthermore, Rydberg atoms speed up the interaction between two adjacent molecules and, more generally, allow us to study such [hybrid quantum systems](https://www.cornishlabs.uk/tweezers). These experiments are all accompanied by corresponding theoretical research on Rydberg systems. For more details on specific projects, follow the links in the text and below.
