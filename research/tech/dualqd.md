## Overview

We aim to create a dual-species tweezer array platform that allows atom-by-atom assembly of scalable quantum systems. By harnessing the complementary strengths of caesium and ytterbium, we will explore new architectures for quantum computing, sensing, and fundamental physics.

## Why?

Learning to control quantum effects such as superposition and entanglement opens the door to new, transformative technologies like quantum computers and quantum sensors. Optical tweezer arrays offer exquisite control over individual quantum systems, trapping single atoms at ultracold temperatures where they can be perfectly isolated from the environment. This allows us to create superpositions of atomic states that last for seconds and by exciting to Rydberg states we can engineer strong interactions between the atoms to entangle them. This approach has been very successful in realising programmable quantum systems of individual atoms for quantum computation, senisng and metrology.  

### Why two species?

Using two atomic species offers different capabilities. Single species systems face challenges because all the atoms are the same, making it hard to perform certain operations like manipulating or measuring a subset of atoms without effecting its neighbours. By adding a second species—cesium and ytterbium in our case—we gain independent control and well suited to applications where atoms must take on distinct roles: such as data and ancilla qubits in quantum error correction or as matter and gauge fields in quantum simulators. This flexibility also opens up new opportunities for quantum sensing and state preparation.

## How?

We will trap and cool cesium and ytterbium atoms to near absolute zero using laser light and magnetic fields in a magneto-optical trap.
From there we will focus grids of tightly-focussed laser spots on the atoms creating optical tweezer arrays. The tightly-confining tweezers allow us to trap and detect individual atoms, combining this with the ability to move the traps around we can arrange the atoms in geometries we require for the experiment at hand.
Once isolated we can control the interactions between atoms by preparing them in specific quantum states and exciting them to highly-excited Rydberg states where they interact strongly. Combined with techniques for quickly measuring the quantum states of the atoms we will explore new schemes for geenrating long-range entanglement in these systems and how best to exploit these quantum resoruces.
