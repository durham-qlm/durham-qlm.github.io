## Quantum Adventures with Trapped Ions: Clocks, Springs, and Qubits

Trapped ions—charged atoms suspended using electric fields—are among the most promising systems for exploring the strange world of quantum physics. In this talk, I’ll introduce how trapped ion experiments work and why they’re such a powerful platform for both fundamental research and emerging technologies. I’ll then delve into three areas of my research. First, I’ll explain how we use quantum entanglement to enhance the precision of atomic clocks. Next, I’ll explore how we can use the spring-like motion of ions to create exotic, nonclassical states of matter that behave in ways we never encounter in everyday life. Finally, I’ll discuss my work in quantum computing at Oxford Ionics—a spinout from the University of Oxford—where we’re working towards a practical quantum computer using ion-trap technology.
