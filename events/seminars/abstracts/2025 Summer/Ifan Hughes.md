## Ifan Hughes

## If we shadows have offended: atoms, big magnets and polarized light

*Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile.* In our research field we use light extensively to learn about the properties of atoms subject to external electromagnetic fields and to collisions from buffer gases. In this talk I will present atomic spectroscopy experiments, along with theoretical predictions from the ElecSus code, that demonstrate the current state of the art for quantitative atom-light interactions in thermal vapours.

*There is no darkness but ignorance.* Intriguingly, for some experiments it is the absence of light that provides useful information. Solar flares pose a serious threat to modern day civilisation. Space-weather forecasting helps us to limit the potentially catastrophic damage caused by such events. Fundamentally this is achieved by studying the (lack of light at certain colours) to measure the magnetic field of the Sun.

*O teach me how I should forget to think.* Finally, I will have a mini rant about how most optics textbooks get some basics of polarization wrong. If you have previously read that “light is a transverse wave” you will be astonished by the spectroscopic results I present where Rubidium atoms interact with the (apparently non-existent) longitudinal light component, with the evidence provided by (potentially offensive) shadows.
