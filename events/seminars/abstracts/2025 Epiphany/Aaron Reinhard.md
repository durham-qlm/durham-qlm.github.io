## Coherent control of three-atom Rydberg states: Research at an American liberal arts college

Neutral atoms in low-lying states make excellent qubits.  They interact weakly and are insensitive to environmental perturbations.  However, to generate entanglement one must make the atoms interact strongly.  This is usually done by promoting them to Rydberg states.  Most experiments use Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in the van der Waals regime, as near-resonant interactions can lead to unwanted energy exchange and decoherence.  Nonetheless, interaction resonances can present an opportunity.

In this talk, I will present a method for generating entanglement by promoting atoms to Rydberg levels near Förster resonance.  The resulting three-atom states can be driven coherently, even in an unstructured bulk gas.  I will present evidence for coherent evolution, as well as preliminary data on the coherence time.  This work was done exclusively with undergraduate student collaborators at Kenyon College.  Therefore, I will briefly discuss the American Liberal Arts approach to higher education, as well as my own approach to undergraduate research mentorship.
