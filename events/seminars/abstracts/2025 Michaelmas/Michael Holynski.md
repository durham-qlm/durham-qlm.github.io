## Quantum sensing, imaging and timing

The ability to coherently interact with atoms and photons has opened prospects from fundamental physics to practical applications. It has enabled a range of precision sensing capabilities for measurements including inertial effects such as gravity and rotation, electromagnetic fields and time, and new capabilities in imaging. Over the last decade, major strides have been realised in bringing these capabilities from the laboratory to field applications. The UK Quantum Technology Research Hub in Sensing, Imaging and Timing is translating quantum devices from the laboratory to field-ready instruments that can demonstrate capability relevant to sectors including healthcare, infrastructure, transport, navigation and security. The next step is addressing the critical barriers to adoption of quantum sensors at scale, which is the focal point of the Quantum Hub, which aims to ensure quantum sensing, imaging and timing deliver their best for society. This talk will provide an introduction to the hub, with a focus on discussing atom interferometry research where we are active in developing sensors for inspecting the underground, providing alternative navigating capabilities, and for investigation of fundamental physics.
