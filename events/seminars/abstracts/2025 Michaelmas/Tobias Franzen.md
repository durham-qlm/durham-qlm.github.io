## Towards quantum networking with arrays of Yb atoms

Arrays of single Yb atoms have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, but as with other platforms scaling remains a challenge. Quantum networking via photonic links presents a possible solution, but will require the development of suitable interfaces. I will be presenting my project on quantum networking with Yb, where I plan to use micro cavities to efficiently couple single photons emitted from Yb atoms into standard telecom fibres, with the goal of generating entanglement between spatially separated Yb qubits. This will be a crucial building block for distributed quantum computing and quantum enhanced remote sensing. However, the size and complexity of current setups would be an obstacle to their practical implementation. In developing my setup, I’m thus paying special attention to compactness and simplifying the complex laser architectures required for cooling and control of Yb.
