## Quantum Error Correction

Quantum error correction protocols will play a central role in the realisation of quantum computing; the choice of error correction code will influence the full quantum computing stack, from the layout of qubits at the physical level to gate compilation strategies at the software level. In this talk, I will give a beginner-friendly introduction to the theory and implementation of quantum error correction, survey recent experimental progress, and outline the challenges ahead in engineering full-scale systems.
