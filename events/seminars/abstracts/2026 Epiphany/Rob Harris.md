## Micro optics for large telescopes

To understand the mysteries the universe astronomers require more and more photons. To allow the collection of those photons the telescopes we build grow larger with every generation. This increase in telescope size is matched by the instruments that go behind them, which increase in size roughly as the diameter of the telescope squared, driving up costs, creating difficulties with materials and meaning instrument development teams grow to hundreds of people. 

In this talk I will detail the work I do trying to find ways to reduce the difficulties created by the latest generation of telescopes. I will discuss how to get light from 8 m (and larger!) class telescopes into single mode fibers and what we can do with it once we have it there. I will delve into the technologies I use, from multicore fibres, to ultrafast laser inscribed waveguides and two-photon polymerisation. I’ll also take the opportunity to tell you about how I’m branching out from astronomy, including my first forays into the world of quantum light and matter.
